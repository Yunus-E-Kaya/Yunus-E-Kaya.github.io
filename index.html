    <p class="yellow"><strong>Bluestacks is a safe working app where you could download anything that's meant to be for mobile, on your PC.
     You wil be able to download the most popular games on the play store on your laptop with this app. Some of those apps are: Among us, Call of Duty Mobile and PUBG.
     It's pretty useful, because if you do not want to pay for apps like Among us which is pay to play on laptop, you just could download it for free!</strong></p>
     <br>

     <br>
     <h3>Steam</h3>

     <br>
     <p class="yellow"><strong>Steam is an app that makes the user able to download many popular games like: GTA V, Brawlhalla and Call of Duty MW or BO.
     But of course you do need to pay for some of those apps. I guarantee you that it's worth it and it's save, so you could be pretty confident when you use your mom's credit card.
     Just make sure you won't spend too much or else the punishment will come.... Anyways some of those apps are able to run while being offline, like Brawlhalla.</strong></p>

     <h3>Tlauncher</h3>

     <br>
     <p class="yellow"><strong>Tlauncher is one of the million free Minecraft downloaders. But this one is kind of working, im sorry to tell you that you CAN'T play it online.
     And its pirated you could get viruses even if your antivirus didn't scan any viruses. But what you could do is flex on your friends that you have minecraft downloaded free on oyur laptop,
     without paying it to play. As always...you have been warned!</strong></p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <p class="yellow"><strong>As you saw there are not many apps here, but I will make sure that there will come some more apps.</strong></p>
